Hotel Network Design & Implementation Using Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains the full implementation of a multi-floor enterprise network designed as part of the CIE 447 Computer Networks course project. The objective of the project was to build a functional and scalable network infrastructure for a three-floor hotel using Cisco Packet Tracer, applying VLAN segmentation, IP subnetting, OSPF routing, DHCP configuration, and inter-floor connectivity using serial links. The design reflects a realistic enterprise environment where different departments operate on isolated VLANs while still maintaining controlled communication and access to shared servers.

The network is based on the address space 192.168.2.0/24, which is subdivided into separate subnets for each department. Every floor includes its own router and switch, and all three routers are connected using serial DCE links located in the IT department’s server room. Departments such as Reception, Store, Logistics, Finance, HR, Sales, Admin, and IT each operate on dedicated VLANs designed to match the device counts specified in the project requirements. The IT floor contains a DNS server, while the Finance department hosts a web server for the www.hotelservices.com
 website, which is accessible to all devices throughout the hotel.

Routing across the entire network is achieved using OSPF, ensuring dynamic route advertisement and reliable inter-floor communication. Each floor’s router is configured as a DHCP server for its own VLANs, enabling automated address assignment for all devices in the network. The Packet Tracer implementation includes complete connectivity verification, demonstrating full communication both within and between floors, as well as successful access to the hotel’s internal web server.

The repository also includes the redesigned network created to accommodate the project’s relocation scenario. In this extended requirement, the Sales department is moved to a remote headquarter network with the address space 192.180.1.0/24, and the Admin department is reassigned to the second floor. The network is restructured accordingly, with updated routing, VLAN assignments, addressing, and connectivity tests. This revised design maintains seamless communication between the local hotel network and the external headquarter network.

This project demonstrates practical experience in enterprise network planning, VLAN-based segmentation, hierarchical addressing, routing protocol configuration, DHCP automation, and multi-site topologies. All implementation steps, subnetting procedures, changes introduced during the relocation phase, and connectivity verification screenshots are included in the corresponding project report.
